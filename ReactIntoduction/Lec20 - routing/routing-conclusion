Conclusion React Router
1. Browser Router ====> <BroserRouter><Routes> <Route path={'/'} element={<Page />}/> </Routes> </BrowserRouter>
   I can not use some feature like errorHandling and loader 
2. createBrowserRoute ======> JSON structure of router 
    2.1 createRouteFromElement ====> to use Routes as JSX

3. Router hooks
    3.1 useParams ===> we use it to read parameter thats we use in dynamic routes (path="/:id")
    3.2 useSearchParams ====> use to read query string
    3.3 useLocation ===> used to detrminate the current location of route, and we can read some data that we passed from other routes by state
    3.4 useRouteError ===> to read erros happen in routing 
    3.5 useLoaderData ===> used to read data passed from loader in Routes
